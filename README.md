Trying to find a way for executing this art project

                                                           ABOUT ME & THE REASONS

   Due to my naivety regarding quite literally everything around cryptos, I was very interested in NFTs without even much of a thought. After I learned of the energy consumption of Ethereum, not to mention its gas fees, and realised most of the sold artworks were quite rubbish IMO or memes bought as investments, my thoughts on the subject made a 180 degrees turn.

   What made me get involved in cryptos at last was their potential for communities, imagining, visioning, and creating beneficial projects. I was already losing my faith again until I passed upon the web3, DAOs, all the work done from an environmental POV, things I don't feel I understand totally, which made more sure that it is not that much of the markets that I am interested in, but on the creation of something meaningless!

   I relate my artisticity to these: outsider/marginal art/-ist; work is mostly (analog) collages these days, though I use all sorts of techniques; my way of working is aleatoric; as I value the Archetype of an Artist verily, I've started collecting art from dead and alive more well-known artists as well as from those working outside the art elites or are studying and the like (aiming to be a proletarian arts patron as often I can), I do want to work within the Art Field.

   I wonder could this encourage for a DAO art gallery, sort of TAZ-esque. **_Comments?_**

                                                                  NOW, THE PROJECT

   Collages have shown to be a very suitable technique for me, and I love their innate ecological nature as trash turns into art. The glue (store bought) used feels like the only thing that could be changed to wheatpaste as a mean to lower its ecological impact. This why it was only natural for me to start creating, thinking of, ideas that utilise collages. Then I got an idea, which seemed worthwhile, but lacking the means of creating it, I still needed to process the idea and try to find a suitable platform.

   Now the artwork itself follows the normal analog collages routine: cut and paste. What differs from the usual one is that every individual piece will be scanned before their final, glued placement. This way through NFTs every individual piece of the work can be auctioned individually and the ownership of the collage will be collective rather than personal. 

   As I wanted to see if I could pursue this further I thought about an interactive website/something where the collage's pieces could be re-arranged individually by the owners of those pieces, and thus creating/visioning something new would be made possible through (anonymous) communal work. 

   These same principals could be taken to assemblages as well, made from found objects, all which would be individually 3D-scanned, auctioned, and made possible to manipulate on an interactive website.

   From all the accumulated worth from the auctions, 31-50% would be used to buy KlimateDAO or the like as a way to support these projects and make the artwork carbon negative.

                                                            H J Ä L P Ä   M I G 

   I would like to receive feedback, input from the community about the project, its feasibility, and the like. If there is people interested in the project I would need help with:
 — Coding the interactive site where the collage(s) and/or assemblage(s) could be reworked and thus create new artworks.
 — Comments which art marketplace to use for this
